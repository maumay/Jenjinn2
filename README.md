# Jenjinn2
Version 2 of my chess engine written in Java. I separated the repositories to demonstrate progress.
To play do the following (if windows swap terminal for command prompt):

1. Run `java -version` in the terminal to check the Java 8 runtime environment is setup.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine and set it as the pwd in the terminal.
3. Run the command `./gradlew clean build` (or `gradlew clean build` on Windows).
5. Run `java -jar build/libs/Jenjinn2.jar`
